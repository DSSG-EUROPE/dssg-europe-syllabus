# SSH and the Cloud
Cloud computing is a computing paradigm popularised by Amazon, which enables access over the internet to shared pools of configurable system resources and higher-level services that can be rapidly provisioned with minimal management effort. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale. 

Each of you has been assigned an individual account that gives you access to Amazon Web Services (AWS), try logging into the portal:

**AWS portal:** [login link](https://dssg-europe.signin.aws.amazon.com/console) <br/>

AWS is one of the most popular cloud based computing services, along with Microsoft's Azure, and IBM Bluemix. These services offer multiple services and their capabilities are being extended all the time. For your projects the most important things to be aware of are:

* Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) - these so called EC2 instances allow users to rent virtual computers on which to run their applications. EC2 encourages scalable deployment of applications. A user can create, launch, and terminate server-instances as needed, paying by the second for active servers â€“ hence the term "elastic". EC2 provides users with control over the geographical location of instances that allows for latency optimisation and high levels of redundancy.
