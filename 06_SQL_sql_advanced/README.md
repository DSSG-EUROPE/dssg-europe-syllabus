# SQL Advanced

Once again, we have some deliveries in this session. Just push them as regularly to exercises folder, using your own created folder

Every "HandsOn" as a delivery Query. However, you should **also** send all corrected queries you find in the way;

### Some cautions:

- Queries have a couple of bugs... can you find them?
- Take your time to fully understand what are you doing...


### Redirecting to Chicago's Session!
